        <h1>Ramadan</h1>
        <p>Ramadan is the 9th month of the Islamic calendar, which is based on a 12 month lunar year of 
            approximately 354 days. Because the lunar year is 11 days shorter than the solar year, each
             lunar month moves 11 days earlier each year. It takes 33 solar years for the lunar months 
             to complete a full cycle and return to the same season. The month traditionally begins and
              ends based on the sighting of the new moon. Starting on April 11th, Muslims throughout the 
              United States and the rest of the world will begin to search the sky for the new crescent, 
              or in some cases, they will follow a pre-determined date based on astronomical calculation.
             In 2021, the month long fast of Ramadan begins around April 13th and ends around May 12th.
        </p>
        <p>
            Muslims fast from pre-dawn to sunset, a fast of between 11-16 hours depending on the time of
            year for a period of 29-30 days. The fast of Ramadan entails forgoing food and drink, 
            and if married, abstaining from sex during sunlit hours. For Muslims, Ramadan is a time 
            to train themselves both physically and spiritually by avoiding any negative acts such as 
            gossiping, backbiting, lying or arguing. Muslims welcome Ramadan as an opportunity for 
            self-reflection, and spiritual improvement, and as a means to grow in moral excellence.
             Ramadan is also a highly social time as Muslims invite each other to break their fast 
             together and meet for prayers at the mosque.
